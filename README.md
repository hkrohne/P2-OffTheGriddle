## Image Credits
		Desktop background image was pulled from Off the Griddle's current website. 
		Mobile and subpage background were made by me. They are meant to replicate the back wall of the restaurant.
		About page image was taken from a google search, which is directed to a pinterest post (https://www.pinterest.com/pin/46232333651010426/)
		Gallery images were taken from Off the Griddle's official instagram (@offthegriddlepdx)
